## Understanding Activist Burnout

Burnout is not personal failure. It is a predictable response to sustained stress, especially when you are fighting against oppressive systems with limited resources. Recognizing burnout early and creating cultures of care within movements is essential for sustainability.

## Signs of Burnout

Physical symptoms include chronic exhaustion, frequent illness, insomnia, and changes in appetite. Emotional signs include cynicism, feeling ineffective, emotional numbness, irritability, and loss of motivation. If you notice these patterns in yourself or comrades, take them seriously.

## Setting Boundaries

You cannot pour from an empty cup, and movements cannot function when everyone is depleted. It is okay to say no to requests, step back from certain roles, or take breaks. Healthy movements have systems that allow people to rest without guilt.

### Rotate Responsibilities

No one person should carry critical organizing tasks indefinitely. Build redundancy by training multiple people in each role. This prevents burnout and strengthens the collective.

## Rest as Resistance

Capitalism demands constant productivity. Taking time to rest, especially for marginalized people, is an act of resistance against systems that extract our labor and vitality. Rest is not laziness; it is necessary for sustained action.

## Collective Care Practices

Individual self-care is important, but burnout is often a structural issue requiring collective solutions. Create care teams within your organization to check in on members, organize social events unrelated to work, and build emotional support networks.

### Debrief After Actions

High-stress actions can leave emotional residue. Hold debriefs where participants can process what happened, express feelings, and receive support. Do not skip this step in the rush to the next action.

## Seek Professional Support

Therapy, counseling, and peer support groups are valuable tools. Many therapists offer sliding-scale fees, and some organizations provide mental health support specifically for activists and organizers.

Remember: taking care of yourself and your comrades is organizing work. Sustainable movements require sustainable people.
