## Before You Go

Your phone contains vast amounts of personal data, including contacts, messages, photos, and location history. Taking steps to secure it before attending a protest can protect both you and your community.

## Essential Security Steps

### Disable Biometric Unlocking

Turn off fingerprint and face recognition before attending any protest. These can be used to unlock your phone without your consent if you are detained. Switch to a strong PIN or password that you do not have to provide under duress.

### Enable Full-Disk Encryption

Most modern phones support encryption. On Android, go to Settings > Security > Encryption. On iOS, encryption is enabled by default when you set a passcode. Ensure this is active.

### Minimize Data on Your Device

Consider leaving your phone at home and using a burner device with minimal data. If you must bring your smartphone, delete sensitive messages, photos, and contact information beforehand. Remove or log out of social media apps that could reveal your network.

### Use Secure Communication

If you need to communicate during an action, use end-to-end encrypted apps like Signal. Enable disappearing messages and verify safety numbers with trusted contacts.

## If You Are Detained

Remember that you have the right to remain silent in many jurisdictions. You are not obligated to provide your phone password or PIN. Police may seize your device, but encryption protects your data if they cannot unlock it.

Power off your phone if you anticipate being detained, as most phones require a PIN on restart and cannot be unlocked with biometrics after a full shutdown.

## After the Protest

Review any photos or videos you took for identifiable faces and metadata. Strip location data before sharing images online to protect participants.
