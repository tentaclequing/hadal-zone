## Disclaimer

This information is general guidance only and not legal advice. Laws regarding protests vary significantly by country and region. Always research your local laws and consult with legal experts or human rights organizations in your area.

## The Right to Protest

Many countries recognize freedom of assembly and expression as fundamental rights. However, restrictions often apply regarding time, place, and manner of protest. Some jurisdictions require permits for large gatherings, while others do not. Know the specific rules in your area.

## Interacting with Police

You may have the right to remain silent when questioned by police. In many jurisdictions, you must provide your name but nothing more. Do not lie; simply state that you prefer not to answer questions without legal representation.

### Document Interactions

If possible, have someone record police interactions. Legal observers are trained volunteers who witness and document police behavior at protests. Their presence can deter rights violations.

### If You Are Stopped

Stay calm. Keep your hands visible. Do not physically resist, even if you believe your rights are being violated. You can assert your rights verbally without escalating the situation.

## If You Are Arrested

Request a lawyer immediately and repeatedly. Do not answer questions without legal representation present. Police may pressure you, claim they will help you, or suggest that cooperation will result in release. Wait for your lawyer.

### Write Down Everything

As soon as you are able, document what happened: time, location, officer names or badge numbers, what was said, and any witnesses. This information is crucial for your defense.

## Legal Support Networks

Connect with legal support organizations before attending protests. Many cities have hotlines staffed by volunteer lawyers who provide free advice to arrested protestors. Save these numbers in a secure way and memorize the hotline if possible.

Know your rights, but also know their limits. Your safety and the safety of your community come first.
