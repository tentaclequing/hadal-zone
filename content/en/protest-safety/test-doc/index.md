## Before You Leave

Preparation is the most important part of protest safety. Most injuries and dangerous situations at protests can be avoided or mitigated with basic planning.

### Tell Someone Where You Are Going

Always tell a trusted person who is not attending the protest where you are going, when you expect to return, and how to reach you. Agree on check-in times. If you miss a check-in, they should know what steps to take.

### Plan Your Route

Study the area beforehand. Identify multiple exit routes from the protest location. Note the nearest public transit stops, hospitals, and safe spaces such as friendly businesses or community centers. Avoid dead ends and narrow alleys.

## What to Bring

Pack light. You may need to move quickly, and heavy bags slow you down.

- **Water** in a squirt bottle (useful for flushing eyes if exposed to chemical irritants)
- **Snacks** with protein and sugar for sustained energy
- **Comfortable, closed-toe shoes** you can run in
- **Weather-appropriate layers** that cover exposed skin
- **A small first aid kit** with bandages, antiseptic wipes, and any personal medications
- **Cash** in small bills (ATMs and card readers may not be accessible)
- **A permanent marker** to write emergency contact numbers on your arm
- **Earplugs** to protect against flashbangs or prolonged loud noise

### What Not to Bring

Leave valuables at home. Do not wear contact lenses if chemical irritants are likely, as they can trap chemicals against your eyes. Avoid wearing jewelry or loose accessories that can be grabbed. Do not bring anything you are not prepared to lose.

## The Buddy System

Never attend a protest alone. Go with at least one trusted person and agree on a plan beforehand.

- Decide on a meeting point outside the protest area in case you get separated
- Agree on a code word that means "we need to leave immediately"
- Check in with each other regularly throughout the event
- Watch each other's backs in dense crowds

If you do not have a buddy, connect with an affinity group or mutual aid network beforehand. Many protest organizing spaces can help match people up.

## Crowd Safety

Large crowds present specific dangers even at peaceful events. Crowd crushes kill and injure people every year, and they can happen without warning.

### Staying Safe in Dense Crowds

- Stay near the edges of the crowd where you have more room to move
- Keep your arms in front of your chest in a protective stance if the crowd becomes very dense
- Move diagonally, not against the flow, if you need to exit
- If you fall, try to get up immediately; if you cannot, curl into a ball to protect your head and torso
- Watch the crowd density ahead of you and leave before it becomes too packed to move

### If a Stampede Begins

Stay on your feet. Do not stop to pick up dropped items. Move with the crowd at an angle toward the nearest exit. If pushed against a barrier or wall, turn sideways to reduce the pressure on your chest.

## De-escalation

Not every tense moment at a protest needs to escalate into conflict. Basic de-escalation skills can protect you and the people around you.

- Stay calm and keep your voice steady and low
- Do not make sudden movements or aggressive gestures
- Create physical space between yourself and the source of tension if possible
- Listen before responding; sometimes people just need to be heard
- Avoid engaging with people who are clearly looking for confrontation

## If Things Go Wrong

### Chemical Irritants

If tear gas or pepper spray is deployed, move upwind and to higher ground. Breathe through a wet cloth if available. Flush affected skin and eyes with water. Do not rub your eyes. Remove contaminated clothing as soon as you can.

### Detainment

If you are detained, stay calm. Provide your name if legally required in your jurisdiction but assert your right to remain silent beyond that. Ask for a lawyer. Memorize the number of a legal support hotline before you go. Do not sign anything without legal counsel.

### Injuries

If someone is injured, call for a street medic if one is present. Apply basic first aid if you are trained. For serious injuries, call emergency services. Do not move someone with a potential spinal injury unless they are in immediate danger.

## After the Protest

Take time to decompress. Protests can be emotionally intense even when nothing goes wrong. Check in with your buddy and your support network. Rest, eat, and drink water. If you witnessed violence or traumatic events, do not hesitate to reach out to a counselor or peer support group. Taking care of yourself is part of taking care of your community.
