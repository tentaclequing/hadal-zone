We are looking for contributors to expand the digital security section of hadal-zone. We especially need guides on:

- Encrypted messaging setup (Signal, Briar, etc.)
- Safe browsing with Tor
- Device security before and after protests
- Operational security basics for organisers

If you have knowledge or experience in these areas, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the [hadal-zone GitHub repository](https://github.com/tentaclequing/hadal-zone).

All contributions are welcome, from full guides to small corrections and translations.
