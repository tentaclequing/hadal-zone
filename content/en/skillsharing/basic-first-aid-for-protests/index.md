## Disclaimer

This information is for educational purposes. If you plan to serve as a street medic, seek proper training from organizations like Street Medic Action or local first aid courses. Always seek professional medical help for serious injuries.

## Tear Gas and Pepper Spray

Chemical irritants like tear gas (CS gas) and pepper spray cause intense burning, tearing, coughing, and temporary blindness. Effects are temporary but extremely uncomfortable.

### Immediate Treatment

Move the affected person away from the contaminated area to fresh air if possible. Help them stay calm and breathe slowly. Blinking rapidly and allowing tears to flow naturally helps flush irritants from the eyes. Do not rub the eyes, as this spreads the chemicals.

### Flushing

Use a water or saline solution to flush exposed skin and eyes. Pour gently from the inner corner of the eye outward to avoid spreading irritants across the face. Some medics carry a mixture of water and liquid antacid (50/50) for flushing, though plain water works too.

Remove contact lenses if possible. Remove contaminated clothing carefully to avoid spreading chemicals, and seal it in a plastic bag.

## Heat Exhaustion

Protests in hot weather can cause heat exhaustion. Symptoms include heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and headache. Move the person to shade, give them water to sip slowly, and apply cool wet cloths to their neck and forehead. If symptoms worsen or the person loses consciousness, call emergency services immediately.

## Panic Attacks

The stress and intensity of protests can trigger panic attacks. Help the person find a quiet space away from the crowd. Encourage slow, deep breathing. Stay with them and speak calmly. Reassure them that they are safe and the feelings will pass.

## When to Seek Professional Help

Call emergency services or get someone to a hospital if they experience:

- Loss of consciousness
- Difficulty breathing that does not improve
- Chest pain
- Severe bleeding that cannot be controlled
- Signs of concussion after head injury
- Severe allergic reactions

## Medic Coordination

If you are acting as a medic, wear visible identification like a red cross armband. Work in pairs when possible. Communicate with other medics to coordinate care and track injuries.

Stay safe, stay prepared, and take care of each other.
