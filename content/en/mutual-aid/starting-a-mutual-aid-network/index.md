## What Is Mutual Aid?

Mutual aid is solidarity-based support where communities directly meet each other's needs without waiting for institutions or charity. Unlike charity, which creates hierarchies between givers and receivers, mutual aid recognizes that we all have something to give and something we need.

## Getting Started

### Identify Your Community

Start small with your immediate neighborhood, building, or street. Map out who lives nearby and what connections already exist. Attend local gatherings, knock on doors, or use community notice boards to introduce yourself.

### Listen to Needs

Conduct informal surveys or hold an initial meeting to identify what people need. Common areas include food access, childcare, transportation, translation services, home repairs, or companionship for isolated neighbors. Do not assume what is needed; ask and listen.

### Build Trust Through Action

Start with small, achievable actions. Organize a monthly food share, create a tool library, or establish a ride-sharing system. Consistent, reliable support builds trust faster than grand promises.

## Coordination Tools

Keep it simple. A group chat on Signal or Matrix, a shared spreadsheet for requests and offers, and regular in-person meetings can be enough to coordinate effectively. Avoid platforms that require personal data or have corporate surveillance.

### Create Clear Processes

Establish how requests are made, who coordinates responses, and how to handle conflicts. Rotate coordination responsibilities to prevent burnout and distribute power.

## Sustainability

Mutual aid networks thrive when they are horizontal and transparent. Share decision-making, celebrate contributions, and check in regularly with participants about what is working and what needs to change.

Remember: mutual aid is not a service you provide to others. It is a relationship of reciprocity. Everyone has skills, time, or resources to share, and everyone has needs. This reciprocity strengthens community resilience.
